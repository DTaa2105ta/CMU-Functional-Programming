\section{Interpreting error messages}

\begin{task}{2} %
What error message do you see when you evaluate the \smle{errors.sml} file
without modifying it?  What caused this error? How can it be
fixed?
\end{task}

\begin{solution}
TYPE YOUR SOLUTION HERE
\end{solution}


\begin{task}{2} %
What is the next batch of errors?  What caused these errors? How can they be
fixed?
\end{task}

\begin{solution}
TYPE YOUR SOLUTION HERE
\end{solution}


\begin{task}{2} %
What error do you see after that?  What caused it? How can it be fixed?
\end{task}

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}


\begin{task}{2} %
What is the next error?  What caused it?  How can it be fixed?
\end{task}

\begin{solution}
TYPE YOUR SOLUTION HERE
\end{solution}


\begin{task}{2} %
After this, you should see two errors.  What are they?  What caused them?  How
can they be fixed?
\end{task}

\begin{solution}
TYPE YOUR SOLUTION HERE
\end{solution}


\begin{task}{4} %
Once you have fixed these errors, you will get a bunch more errors.  Two
simple fixes are sufficient to make them go away.  What are these errors? What
caused them? What are the fixes?

about the applicative behavior of the function \smle{octal}? Say
why, briefly.

\section{Inductive Definitions}

\subsection{The Hosoya triangle}

\begin{task}{8} %
Give an inductive definition of the \emph{Hosoya coefficient} $H(n,k)$
\textbf{based on the way the Hosoya triangle is built}.  Consider carefully
the number of base and inductive cases, and the conditions under which each
applies.
\end{task}

\begin{solution}
TYPE YOUR SOLUTION HERE
\end{solution}


\begin{task}{5} %
The mathematical property defining that the left edge of the Hosoya triangle
corresponds to the Fibonacci number sequence is as follows:

\begin{property}
\label{prop:left-edge}
For all natural number $n$,
$$
H(n,0) = Fib(n)
$$
\end{property}
Prove this property by induction on $n$.
\end{task}

\begin{solution}
TYPE YOUR SOLUTION HERE
\end{solution}


\begin{task}{10} %
By induction on $n$, prove the following property:

\begin{property}
\label{prop:h-fib}
  For all natural numbers $n$ and $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$,
  $$
  H(n,k) = Fib(k) \times Fib(n-k)
  $$
\end{property}
\textbf{Hint:} your  proof should match the structure of your inductive
definition for $H$ exactly: same cases, same conditions.
\end{task}

\end{solution}


\begin{task}{3} %
You may have noticed that each row of the Hosoya triangle has the same numbers
whether read from left to right or from right to left (the Hosoya triangle has
vertical symmetry).  This is mathematically expressed by the following
property:

\begin{property}
\label{prop:symmetry}
  For all natural numbers $n$ and $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq n$,
  $$
  H(n, k) = H(n, n-k)
  $$
\end{property}

Prove this property.
\end{task}

\begin{solution}
TYPE YOUR SOLUTION HERE
\end{solution}


\begin{task}{3} %
Symmetry (or an easy observation) allows us to conclude that the rightmost
edge of the Hosoya triangle is again the Fibonacci numbers.  Formulate this
fact as a mathematical property and prove it.
